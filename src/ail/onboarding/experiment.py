"""Fresh-experiment **validation** and **creation** for the onboarding wizard.

Wizard page 1 (``docs/ONBOARDING_WIZARD.md`` §32): point an agent at a **fresh**
MLflow experiment (one agent per experiment), or **create** one from the app. Both
are handled here behind a narrow, injectable :class:`ExperimentClient` seam so the
orchestration is unit-testable with no live MLflow (mirroring the injectable client
seams in :mod:`ail.jobs.readiness_preflight` and :mod:`ail.judges.registration`).

**Honest / fail-closed, always.** "Fresh" means *empty of prior AIL state*: the
experiment exists, carries **no traces**, and is **not already claimed** by a
registered agent. If the identity cannot read the experiment or its traces
(auth / permission), validation raises :class:`ExperimentAccessError` — it never
reports "fresh" it could not verify. Creation is permission-sensitive: the app
service principal needs **experiment-create** authority; when it is missing the
MLflow call fails and :func:`create_experiment` surfaces an
:class:`ExperimentPermissionError` naming the prerequisite — it never reports a
created experiment that did not actually get created.
